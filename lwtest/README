About lwtest
===============
The Likewise Test Suite (lwtest) validates the proper operation of the LSA APIs.

Validation is performed by exporting information from a domain (either by
scripts or by hand) into a comma-separated-value (CSV) file in the appropriate
format. This file is loaded by the various test tools and used as both input to
the LSA APIs and to check responses from those APIs.

Note that not every user in the domain must be in this file, but only those
found in the file will be used to drive the tests. Some APIs operate over all
users in the domain and so those tests may take a while if you have very many
users.


BASIC SETUP

1.      SETUP A DOMAIN
Set up a domain with some users and groups. It is suggested that this domain
be purely for testing so that exposed user and administrative passwords are not
a problem. If you wish to use a live domain, you should edit the script
lwtest.sh to not perform a join (which generally requires the Administrator
password).

It is also suggested that user names be evocative of properties of that user to
make trends easier to spot: AliasUser0001, ExpiredUser0001, DisabledUser0001 for
users that have an alias, expired password or disabled account, respectively.

2.      DATA PREPARATION

Create two CSV files (one for users and one for groups) in the lwtest format.

You may use the ExportCsv.vbs script (run as an administrator on a DC) to
extract user and group information from the domain into the appropriate CSV
format. Note that this script does not do all the work necessary for preparing
the CSV data files. ***You must verify what the script generates.***

For example, in the User CSV file You will need to put in the proper passwords,
UnixUid, UnixGid, UnixGecos, UnixLoginShell,UnixHomeDirectory.  [Passwords are
never stored on the DC and so are not available for export. The Unix*
information is a core part of the test process and Likewise product and we have
yet to agree on a robust method of automatically deducing this information that
does not compromise the tests.]

Additionally, aliased users are not written with the proper name by the scripts.

3.      TEST PREPARATION
Create a test description file 'mytests.lwtest' which describes how to join the
domain, where test results should be saved, and what CSV files are to be loaded.

An example is 'lwtest/scripts/example.lwtest'.

4.      TEST EXECUTION
Execute 'sudo /opt/likewise/bin/lwtest.sh mytests.lwtest'.
A summary will be printed to the screen and a more detailed report where
in the path specified by example.lwtest:$LWT_LOG_FILE.

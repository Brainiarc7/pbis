OpenSOAP Samples
================

The following examples have been prepared as OpenSOAP sample programs.
For more details please read the README file in each of the directories.

To compile, the Makefile provided in each directory ${DIR}.mak is used,
and not the Makefile generated by the configure command.
  $ make -f Hello.mak clean (If executables were generated by the full compile)
  $ make -f Hello.mak

In order to use, the service commands must be installed in the CGI-BIN,
and necessary files in the OpenSOAP Server directory.
  $ vi Hello.mak (If necessary modify CGI_BIN_DIR)
  $ su
  # make -f Hello.mak install
  -> The HelloService.cgi, HelloService and Hello.ssml are copied.
    (If the ssml file has been modified, you must 'reload' the OpenSOAP server)

Test rules in the ${DIR}.mak files are available. To verify, use the make
command as follows.
  $ make -f Hello.mak stest   (Service Test)
  $ make -f Hello.mak ctest   (Client Test)

Make rules for compilation and installation  have been prepared for
each of the samples located under the "samples" directory.
  $ cd [unpack-directory]/samples
  $ make clean-samples
  (Performs a "clean" on all sample directories)
  $ make all-samples
  (Builds all the sample executables in their respective directories)
  $ sudo make install-samples
  (Installs the sample program executables)

---------------------------------------------------------
Hello
A very simple service/client sample.
If a name is supplied by the client, the service will respond with that name.

---------------------------------------------------------
SimpleCalc
A very simply implemented service/client calculation sample.

---------------------------------------------------------
CalcAsync
Simple arithmetic service and client sample utilizing the OpenSOAP Server
Asynchronous features. This sample also allows the maximum hop limit and
forward server path to be specified.

---------------------------------------------------------
Calc
A simple arithmetic client and service sample code which can be
verified with the MS Soap Toolkit.

---------------------------------------------------------
HelloSec
Hello sample secure version.
An OpenSOAP security function usage and execution example.

---------------------------------------------------------
ShoppingSec
A shopping Web service service/client sample. Sychronous only, asynchronous,
both 

---------------------------------------------------------
SecCertAuth
Security verification sample.
This includes both a data registration command(Regist) and a certificate
acquisition service/client(GetCert).

---------------------------------------------------------
Base
Sample code illustrating a very basic usage of the OpenSOAP API.

---------------------------------------------------------
Security
Sample code illustrating the use of OpenSOAP security features.

---------------------------------------------------------
Transaction
Transaction processing sample.

---------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------
*OBSOLETE*
Shopping
This has changed to ShoppingSec(as of 1.0pre2).

Soaping
The PING implementation displaying the service response time.
Moved to the basic service tool(src/tools/). (from 1.0-20021031)

CalcAsyncHop, CalcAsyncPath
These sample services and corresponding clients have been discontinued
with the release of  OpenSOAP Ver1.0-20030201. These features are now
incorporated into the CalcAsync sample.
